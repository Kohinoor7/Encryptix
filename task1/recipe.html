                            Make a delicious homemade pizza with a simple dough, savory tomato sauce, and your favorite toppings. Start by preparing a yeast-based dough that rises to a perfect, fluffy crust. Spread a rich tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and herbs over the dough, then top with shredded mozzarella, Parmesan, and your choice of toppings. Bake at a high temperature until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Slice and enjoy your fresh, homemade pizza!

                        2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
                        1 large onion, finely chopped <br>
                        3 cloves garlic, minced <br>
                        1 tablespoon ginger, minced <br>
                        2 tablespoons curry powder <br>
                        1 teaspoon ground cumin <br>
                        1 teaspoon ground coriander <br>
                        1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes <br>
                        1 cup coconut milk <br>

                        Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</p>
                    <p>Instructions: <br>

                        Heat Oil: In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. <br>
                        Cook Onion: Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown, about 5 minutes. <br>
                        Add Garlic and Ginger: Stir in the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for an additional minute. <br>
                        Add Spices: Add the curry powder, cumin, and coriander. Stir well to coat the onions, and cook for another minute until fragrant. <br>
                        Cook Chicken: Add the chicken pieces and cook until no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes. <br>
                        Add Tomatoes and Coconut Milk: Pour in the diced tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir to combine. <br>
                        Simmer: Reduce heat and let the curry simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Season with salt and pepper. <br>
                        Garnish and Serve: Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with rice or naan. <br>
